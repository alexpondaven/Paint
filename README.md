This is a collection of projects that I have done to learn JavaScript and to develop my knowledge of algorithms.

Includes:
- Paint site: Used p5.js library to create a site where you can draw using the cursor.
- Particle Physics: moving particles with elastic collisions and momentum (mass proportional to size)
- Merge sort: Visualising of the merge sort algorithm step by step (Work In Progress)
